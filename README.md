The Stratified Ocean Model with Adaptive Refinement (SOMAR)
=====

#Getting started
SOMAR is built upon Chombo 3.1, an AMR framework that has been developed and is being distributed by the Applied Numerical Algorithms Group of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. Before you can compile SOMAR, you must first download the Chombo software from [https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo](https://commons.lbl.gov/display/chombo/Chombo+-+Software+for+Adaptive+Solutions+of+Partial+Differential+Equations), then build its libraries. We strongly advise that you look at the Chombo Design document for compilation instructions and prerequisites.
